# Simple-Pack-of-Union-Plugins
There is a simple pack of Union plugins for Gothic 2 , Gothic 2 Night of The Raven and The Chronciles Of Myrtana Archolos.


This simple pack consists a coule of Quality of Life modificacions for Gothic family games.

All of mods that I use here are requiring download of modding tool known as "Union". 

Here is a summary of plugins and short descriptions:

Union_AcrobaticSwitch - Let's you change the type of jump from acrobatic long jump to untrained basic jump if needed using "Ctrl" key (It can be changed in file setting).


Union_HotBar - Grants you access to hotbar that can hold up to 9 Items and can be mange form inventory


Union_MarkItems - Adds diffrent types of marks to items depending of their type such as wepons, consumables or books.


Union_QuickLoot - Let's you pick up items with no animation with a simple use of one key ("V" if unchaged).


Union_TorchControl - Let's you use torch without need to go to inventory. (WARNING - There might be some issues if you play moddificacion that changes torch mechanics).


Union_XpBar - Add's visible bar that shows how much xp do you need to get next level. ( WARNING - The mod will break if used to "Take control" of an NPC).


Union_zUtilities - A bunch of quality of life changes.



To plugins to work you need to create in case of Chronicles of Mytrana - Archolos a folder with name "Plugins" and then place them there.

If you do not want one or more of mentioned above mods feel free to delete them from folder.


I do not claim any ownership of "Union" tool or any of mencioned plugins. All rights belongs to their respective ovners.
